 * See [Usage](#usage) for guidance on how to use this repository.
 * See [Samples](#samples) for examples of what our text-conditional model can generate.


# Usage

Install with `pip install -e .`.

To get started with examples, see the following notebooks:

* [image2pointcloud.ipynb](file_ee/examples/image2pointcloud.ipynb) - sample a 3D model, conditioned on a text prompt.
* [text2pointcloud.ipynb](file_ee/examples/text2pointcloud.ipynb) - sample a 3D model, conditioned on a synthetic view image. To get the best result, you should remove background from the input image.
